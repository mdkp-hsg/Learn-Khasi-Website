                		Do you want us to build an iOS and WebApp version for our Learn Khasi app?<br/>
                		Well it takes time, effort and skills to build them and currently it's in our plan but we need your support to help raise funds in order to build them. <br/> You can help by making a donation below and select: "RAISE FUND FOR BUILDING Web and iOS App". If you want to know our estimate bugdet and what is the cost to develop and deploy our app contact us via email: sngurshillong@gmail.com.
